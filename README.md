### 🤣 **Just for Fun!**

⚡ _"Why do electrical engineers make bad criminals?"_  
👉 **Because they always follow the path of least resistance!** 😂  

🔌 _"I have too many projects on my plate... But don’t worry, I’m wired for this!"_ 😎  

⚠️ **Warning:** Too much VLSI can cause excessive simulation time!
